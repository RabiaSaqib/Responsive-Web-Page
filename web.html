        <h2>What is Responsive Web </h2>
        <p>An strategy to developing online interfaces that "react" to a user's device is known as responsive web design.
           It allows web apps or websites to be adjusted to any device, window, or screen size.<br>
            Responsive design makes use of fluid grids that are appropriately measured, 
            as compared to traditional design methods that rely on pixels. The same is true with responsive pages, 
            which automatically adjust to fit any device's screen size. Additionally, they use pliable, or so-called "fluid," 
            images that can alter their shape in addition to size and position as needed.</p>

        <h2>Why is Responsive Web Design Important</h2>
        <p>
            Today, more than three billion people use smartphones globally.
            In the upcoming years, it is anticipated to increase by several hundred million more.
            It implies that simply developing a website is insufficient today. More and more people are using their 
            smartphones to do internet activities. Because of this, it's crucial to build designs that will appear 
            well on their devices. A flexible design strategy is the ideal option in this case.<br>

            To avoid ruining your users' impression of your website, make sure your web app or website's
             UI/UX design works flawlessly on each device they may use, including computers, laptops, tablets, and smartwatches.

         having more benefits than disadvantages. Responsive web design enables a 
         single layout to adapt to various displays without sacrificing functionality
         and aesthetics, in contrast to adaptable web design, which produces many layouts for various screen sizes.<br>

           To further comprehend how responsive design functions, let's look at some examples.

        <p>
            One of the frequently asked questions is,
             “why responsive web design should be used?” Responsive web design comes with loads of benefits. 
             One of these benefits of responsive web design is the websites’ load speed and absence of content distortion,
              which eliminates any need for manual content resize. Other benefits are listed below:<br>

            Low maintenance costs. Compared to adaptive design, where many sheets are created for different screens, responding to design is cheaper.
            <br>
            Simple analytics. Responsive web design simplifies the process of collecting analytical data on site users and sources of traffic.
            <br>
            Improved SEO. Google ranks mobile-friendly sites higher than those that do not have mobile optimization.
            <br>
            Better user-friendliness. Responsive web design helps users to benefit by making it easier 
            to continue viewing content without Internet connection as long as the content is within the HTML web app.
